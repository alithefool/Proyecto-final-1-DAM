Questions: 

-Why is busquedas and usuarios connected? I think we could add a table that is limited in attributes but represents how the service makes the searches, so that nothing passes fk to users and makes it an independent table. searches can still be made without being registered, 

- in the same vein, are we sure we want users to be able to make changes and create mazos but without being registered? this to me defeats the requirements of the assignment of creating a service undermining the process of registration, a key feature of our assignment.
